  <h2 align="center"><a>Overview</a></h2>

  <p align="center">
Our online store project leverages the power of open-source technologies to provide a robust and flexible solution for building e-commerce websites. The project is developed using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. We believe in the principles of open-source development, transparency, and collaboration.

<h2 align="center"><a>Project Goals</a></h2>

</div>


* <strong>Open Source Infrastructure:</strong> We rely on the open-source ecosystem, with the server-side built on Node.js using the Express framework.

* <strong>Data Storage with MongoDB:</strong> Data storage and retrieval are handled using MongoDB, a popular open-source NoSQL database.

* <strong>MVC Design:</strong> The project adheres to the MVC pattern, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

* <strong>Extensible Models:</strong> The project supports multiple models, including products, customers, and suppliers. We encourage the community to expand on these models.

* <strong>Shopping Cart and Orders:</strong> Our system includes a shopping cart feature for users to place orders and view their order history. Contributions to enhance this feature are welcome.

* <strong>Manager Interface:</strong> We offer a manager interface for store managers to efficiently manage customer orders, order details, and products.

* <strong>Admin System:</strong> A fully operating admin system is an essential part of our project, providing comprehensive control over the online store's operations and configurations.

* <strong>Open Data Population:</strong> We aim to populate the store with meaningful open data before deployment to resemble a real store. Join us in contributing data.

* <strong>Robust Error Handling and Validations:</strong> The project emphasizes robust error handling, both on the server and client sides, ensuring a smooth user experience.

* <strong>JQuery Integration:</strong> We make extensive use of the JQuery library for client-side interactions, including Ajax calls to the server. Enhancements using JQuery are encouraged.

* <strong>Statistical Insights:</strong> The project provides statistical data using at least two graphs, dynamically updating based on available information. We welcome contributions to improve data visualization.

* <strong>Web Service Integration:</strong> Our system integrates at least one open web service, facilitating data exchange and display on the website. Join us in expanding these integrations.

* <strong>Maps Integration:</strong> We integrate maps using open services like Google Maps or Bing Maps, marking addresses from the database. We invite contributions to enhance map functionality.

* <strong>Social Media API Interaction:</strong> The project interfaces with social media APIs like Twitter or Facebook, allowing for user login and interactions. Help us improve social media integration.
